# DaysInMonth
Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (1 = January, 2 = February, and so on) and then prints the number of days of the month. For February, print "28 days".  You will use a switch statement to accomplish this task.  If they enter an invalid month, it needs to let them know.  (hint:  default part of switch)
